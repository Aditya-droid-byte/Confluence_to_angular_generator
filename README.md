# Confluence_to_angular_generator
This was created to simplfy and reduce development time of angular screen. This application utilizes LLAMA model with confluence to generate angular code. Just provide the content id, and the application will pick the page and read the data and genrate a boiler plate code and sometime whole screen.
<br> NOTE: This is a test product but still work perfectly fine. 
<br> NOTE: For application to generate code, you have provide the data in a specific way. For example to create a form you have to create a table in confluence with proper data.
<br> Hugging face was used to download the model and run it locally.
